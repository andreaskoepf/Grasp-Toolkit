# Grasp-Toolkit
Grasp Toolkit Code and full thesis document

Disclaimer:
- This repository exists mainly for archival purposes and contains the  work I did for my master thesis on robotic grasping.  I worked on this a while back and so much of it may not be relevant/useful given the current state of the art in the field of intelligent robotic grasping.  The [PDF Document](A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR EFFECTIVE GRASP SYNTHESIS AND THE
INTRODUCTION OF A COMPUTATIONAL TOOLKIT FOR EXPLORING THE
GRASPING PROBLEM.pdf) describes the details of this work at length.
- The document is comprised of two parts
  - Part 1 describes a method for grasp synthesis applicable to multifigered hands.  It also contains examples of its
    applications on various hand models.
  - Part 2 describes a Matlab toolkit for simulating grasping tasks. It uses bullet physics for collision and  
dynamics computations through Matlab Mex Files.

- All of the code for the experiments, demos, etc. described in the thesis document is contained in this repository. 
- Documentation for this code is minimal so getting it to a functional state is a non-trivial task.
