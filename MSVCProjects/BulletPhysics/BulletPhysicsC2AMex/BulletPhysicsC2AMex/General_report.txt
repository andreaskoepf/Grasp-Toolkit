Tentative Changes:

 - Need to recompile the physics library to support double type precision by defining BT_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION in build system or at the top of
   Bullet/src/LinearMath/btScalar.h
   
 - try using the offset trimesh instead of the one that contains the mesh placed at the origin
